//This program creates a group class.
/*Exercise outline:
Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add,
delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds
a value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member), delete removes
its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean
value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine
whether two values are the same.
Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument
and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it
